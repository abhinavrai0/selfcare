# selfcare

CSC 591-UX Team Project under the guidance of Dr Ben Watson and All Scripts.

Using 'Balsamiq' design tool, designed a prototype mobile app to allow patients to better manage their own health through good nutrition and exercise.
Focus was on the novelty of UI and an array of features not supported at present by existing apps and systems.
